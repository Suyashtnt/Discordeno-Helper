Now that you have git installed, an editor and some understanding of ts, Deno and have a github account, lets install the template to help start your bot with some example commands.

# Setting up the repository

Lets get started by creating the repository with your bots

first, go to <https://github.com/Suyashtnt/discordeno-helper-template> and click `Use this template`

Now, Set the repository name to something meaningful, e.g `My-first-bot`. Since this is not really public set it to private and click `create`

# Cloning the repository

Now that we have a repository, lets clone it into our machine.

In the new repository, click code and copy the git URL, then open up a terminal and go to the folder where you want the bot folder to be(NOT the place where the code is.)(e.g Documents) type `git clone [YOUR REPO URL]` with [YOUR REPO URL] being the link you just copied

You now have the bot code on your pc, but there is more to do before you can run it! Go to the next page to see more
