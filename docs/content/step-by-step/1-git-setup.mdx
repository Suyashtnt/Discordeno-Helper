# Installing

## Installing the CLI

We will now be installing the CLI. This is the terminal interface for git.

First, go to the [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install the version for your OS. I'm using windows so I'll use <https://git-scm.com/download/win>

Once downloaded click next and next again(unless you need to change the install location)

Make sure that on the select component screen all these are selected:

- Git LFS
- Associate .git files

I have some extras selected as seen below

Now click next, If you have a start menu folder screen just click next.

Now it will ask you for your default editor. For now set this to custom and make it `notepad`

Next, it will ask you for your `PATH environment`, make sure it is the second option(`Git from the command line and also third-party software`)

It will now ask you for your HTTPS backend, set this to `openSSL`

It will ask you for your line endings, this is how file editors see your code. CRLF(\r\n) is windows one while LF(\n) in linuxes one. I personally set this to `Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style`

Now for git bash, set this to whichever you think you like. I choose MinTTY because it looks better than Command prompt

Set `git pull`s behavior to `Default`. This is the best option as it doesn't override other peoples changes but tries to merge them.

For the credential manager, set this to `Git credential manager` or `Git credential manager core`

For extra options keep this as default

Don't enable any bleeding-edge features as it might break things. Now click install

Git is now installed! Open a terminal and run `git --version`. If you get something similar to `git version 2.28.0.windows.1` then you're good to go!
